    <h2>Definition of khyber pakhtunkhwa</h2>
    <p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) is one of the four provinces of Pakistan, located in the northwestern region of the country. It shares borders with Afghanistan to the west, Punjab to the southeast, and Gilgit-Baltistan to the northeast. The province is known for its rugged terrain, diverse culture, and historical significance.</p>
    <h2>Geography:</h2>
    <p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's landscape is dominated by mountainous regions, including the famous Hindu Kush and Karakoram ranges.

        The province also has several important rivers, including the Kabul River and the Indus River, which provide vital water resources for agriculture and hydroelectric power.</p>
        <h2>Ethnic and Linguistic Diversity:</h2>
        <p>The majority of the population in KPK are Pashtuns (Pathans), known for their rich cultural heritage and deep-rooted traditions of hospitality, honor, and valor. The Pashto language is widely spoken, though Hindko and Saraiki are also spoken in some regions. Urdu serves as a secondary language, particularly in urban areas.</p>
        <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
        <p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been a crossroads for various civilizations due to its strategic location. It has seen the influence of Persians, Greeks, Mauryans, Mughals, and British.

            The region has deep ties to Buddhism as well, with ancient Buddhist relics and stupas found in places like Takht-i-Bahi and Peshawar, once a center of Gandhara civilization.</p>
            <h2>Culture:</h2>

Music and poetry are an integral part of the culture, with Pashto poetry and traditional music (using instruments like the rabab) being especially popular.

                Festivals such as Eid, Nowruz, and Jashn-e-Baharan are celebrated with great enthusiasm, and traditional attire like shalwar kameez and Peshawari chappal are iconic to the region.</p>
